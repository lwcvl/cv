# My Work in Digital Humanities

> I have been working to make computer technology useful for both Islamic Studies and Manuscripts Studies.

There are two flagship projects that define my work: _The Digital Orientalist_ and _Among Digitized Manuscripts_

The genesis of this project was the realization that I was making quite a few hacks, coming up with a number of tricks, and thinking through the best strategy for some of the more mundane uses of technology in our work, all of which could be useful to others around me. Thus, I put effort in generating practical examples and theoretical reflections on using technology in our day-to-day workflow. The primary audience was my colleagues so that we may together improve the digital literacy of our field. But I realized that librarians were also interested in hearing about this. 

### Main Project: Online Magazine
1. www.digitalorientalist.com is a website launched in 2013 as a personal blog that has since then grown into an online magazine run by a team of six from three different continents, reaching a global audience of tens of thousands.

### Videos
2. A talk in which I predict how computer vision can enter Humanities research
