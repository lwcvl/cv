            'The world of image',
            <i>ʿālam al-mithāl</i>, also referred to as 'imaginal world', is a concept developed by medieval Islamic intellectuals.
            It is highly innovative and finds no direct ancestor in Greek philosophy, nor even a distant cousin in any other
            culture. Studying this notion is one of the key ways to dismantle the narrative that the Islamic world entered
            a dark age after the 11
            <sup>th</sup> century, from which it supposedly never recovered.
            <br> It seems to me that the notion was picked up in four distinctly different ways. Each of these four ways will
            be subject to an investigation through a project. The first two projects are described below.

                    <b>1. </b>The first way is how the philosopher Suhrawardī (d. 1191) and his commentators developed the notion.
                    They eventually propose this term to denote a world beyond our earthly world, to be reached in sleep,
                    meditation or after death. This world of image consists of non-physical (imagined) bodies, providing
                    a philosophical interpretation of bodily resurrection.</p>

                    <b>2. </b>Ibn ʿArabī (d. 1240), the great mystic who had a tremendous influence on Islamic culture, together
                    with his commentators, also uses the notion, but in a different way. For them, the world of image explains
                    the multiplicity of creation and its characteristic of constantly going in and out of existence. If God
                    alone truly exists, then the actual creation is a mere act of imagination of Him. Humans can therefore
                    penetrate the truth of existence best through their imaginative faculty of imagination, not their intellectual
                    faculty.
