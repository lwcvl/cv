# My Work in Digital Humanities

> I have been working to make computer technology useful for both Islamic Studies and Manuscripts Studies.

There are two flagship projects that define my work: _The Digital Orientalist_ and _Among Digitized Manuscripts_

The genesis of this project is simply the realization that I was making quite a few hacks, coming up with a number of tricks, and thinking through the best strategy for some of the more mundane uses of technology in our work. 
First for my colleagues so that we may together improve the digital literacy of our field. But second librarians to give a perspective of where things are going.

### Main Project: Online Magazine
1. www.digitalorientalist.com is a website launched in 2013 as a personal blog that has since then grown into an online magazine run by a team of six from three different continents, reaching a global audience of tens of thousands.


### Publications
2. [A manifesto](https://github.com/lwcvl/cv/blob/master/DH/LWCvL%20Digital%20Orientalist%20MELANotes%2088.pdf) published in _MELA Notes_, a journal for librarians.

3. [A review](https://github.com/lwcvl/cv/blob/master/DH/LWCvL%20Review%20Muhanna%20JAOS137.3.pdf) of a book that does a good job at introducing DH for Islamic and Middle East Studies, published in the _Journal of the American Oriental Society_.
